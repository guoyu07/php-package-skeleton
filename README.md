# PHP Package Skeleton

This skeleton is an example package using the standard filesystem structure as proposed by <https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton>.
In contrast to PDS Skeleton it adds some additional folders and files.

## Summary

The package contains the following root-level directories:

| Directory              | Description                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bin/`                 | command-line executables                      |
| `config/`              | configuration files                           |
| `docs/`                | documentation files                           |
| `examples/`            | example files                                 |

## Installation

We use Composer to create a new project from this skeleton package. Simply run the following command: 

    $ composer create-project tebe/php-package-skeleton myproject

The idea is to remove the parts from the created project that are not used or not useful for your project.
